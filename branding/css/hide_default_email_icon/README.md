# Hide default email icon

Adding this CSS to Canvas will hide the "default email" star icon in the User settings page and not allow users to change their default email in Canvas.

**Note**: As with any part of Canvas, the links that these CSS Selectors target could change at any time. Be sure to check your beta environment before each production release to be sure that none of your JS/CSS has broken due to an upcoming code change.

## Support

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in mind. Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this. That said, the community will hopefully help support and keep both the script and this documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
